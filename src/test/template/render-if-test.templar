and you should NOT see the above text 'this bean is dead'{nl}

the first test is in the positive: {if bean2.isAlive}this bean2 isAlive{endif}{nl}
and you should NOT see the text above 'this bean2 isAlive'{nl}

the next test is in the negative: {if !bean2.isAlive}this bean2 is dead{endif}{nl}
and you should see the above text 'this bean2 is dead'{nl}
