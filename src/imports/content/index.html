<p><strong>Key Concepts</strong></p>

<p>
	For those that are looking to dive straight into the code, there are only two 
	simple key concepts that need to be understood, namely:
</p>

<dl>
	<dt><strong>the parsing</strong></dt>
	<dd>
		The templar files (by convention having a '<code>.templar</code>' extension) are first parsed and tokenised.
	</dd>
	<dt><strong>the rendering</strong></dt>
	<dd>
		Once parsing has successfully completed, the parsed files are then rendered.
	</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
	Templar was designed with the following goals:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>light-weight - only one dependency (and this is to allow JSON values for the context - and this is built in!)</li>	
	<li>whitespace is important - we (sometimes) care about newlines, spaces and tabs</li>
	<li>easy to use</li>
	<li>just powerful enough</li>
</ul>

<p>
	When <a href="https://github.com/synapticloop/h2zero">h2zero</a> was in it's infancy, 
	we needed a templating engine that would satisfy all of the above criteria - 
	especially the whitespace - which we see as on of the most important ones 
	(<em>no one likes generated code that is ugly</em>).  So we search around and 
	evaluated the following:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Velocity</li>
	<li>FreeMarker</li>
	<li>StringTemplate</li>
	<li>JSPs !!!</li>
</ul>

<p>
	All required huge libraries, lots of dependencies until we found the (now very much defunct) JavaTemplar engine 
	from <a href="https://code.google.com/p/javatemplar/">https://code.google.com/p/javatemplar/</a> (last updated 
	July 2011). (although we do like their icon!).
</p>

<p>
	Whilst this didn't quite have enough functionality to do what we required, it inspired us to build our own, 
	which has now grown into a feature-rich templating engine.
</p>

<p>
	In fact this site was generated with <a href="https://github.com/synapticloop/templar-gen/">synapticloop templar-gen</a> 
	which utilises the library.
