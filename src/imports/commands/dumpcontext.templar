			<h4><code class="large">{{dumpcontext}</code> - dumping the context <a name="command-dumpcontext">&nbsp;</a></h4>

			<p>
				This is useful for debugging as this will render all of the objects in the context, and will look like this:
			</p>

{set "world" as hello}

<pre><code>{dumpcontext}</code></pre>

				We cheated a little bit and added something to the context with the following:
			</p>

<pre><code>{pre {set "world" as hello} pre}</code></pre>
